- The first time the app is opened, the clock hands will show 00:00 AM/Am.
- For the time format used is 12 hours, or am / pm.
- Slide the clock hands as desired and set am / pm.
- if you want to activate the alarm, you can click the switch button on the top right.
- Once active, a notification will appear according to the selected time.
- if the notification is clicked, it will display a bar chart
  indicating the x-axis is the day and time that the alarm sounds,
  while the y-axis is the length of time (in seconds) from when we get a notification until we open it.
